Steve and Jake's Final Project


Login and signup activity connected to firebase and fully operational (premade account details test@example.com pleasework12345!)

Main recycler view activity contains cards and fab to launch add class activity (cards will work more like true cards in the future where you click and it expands to show location and all of our stats)

gps activity is launched from a button on the create account page for now (will be tied to individual class's card and be launched from the main cardview activity in the future)
